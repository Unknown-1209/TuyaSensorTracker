# TuyaSensorTracker
A Tuya contact sensor is placed on a door, when the door is opened it triggers an open event. The Raspberry Pi tracking program listens for this event and records this event. This event is then recorded onto a CSV file with the date and time of the event, the door count, the interval between door opens, and the duration of the door opening.
